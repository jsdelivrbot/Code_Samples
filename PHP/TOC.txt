The files contained within this zip file are samples of some custom code work
that I have done that did not involve another framework.

dexplorer-2.0.php : This is the second itereation of a utility script I had written for my own purposes to allow for the visual display of files on my server at home

class.rentalcalendar.php : This was part of a defunct project to provide a graphical calendar for a rental property management company's internal processes.

Image Manipulation : A folder containing four utility scripts for maipulating images 
using the built in GD library.

v1 : Contains example code of class files written for various company projects. These
were chosen for not being client/application specific.

v2 : Revised or adapted versions of classes from v1 that either use newer methods afforded
with newer versions of PHP ot different methods.

Additionally, code for other languages may be provided upon request.
