Code Samples
============

Some samples of my code work. It's just very general examples of the work I do. Some of it is a little dated,
as I do not want to put too much of my employer's client's code out on the Internet. If there are 'complete' applications, they are either samples build during self learning, proof of concept apps, or hack-a-thon products.

* PHP: Examples of my work with PHP
* Java: Examples of my work with Java.
* Javascript: Examples of my work in Javascript
