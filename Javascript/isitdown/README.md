Is It Down
=============
Hack-A-Thon Team 3 Project
-------------

The purpose of this project is to address the difficulty in identifying if a server, service, or network resource
is available.

The project provides a web interface for displaying a hierarchical list of information collected from various reporting APIs
and consolidating this inforation with relevant on call information. This way, should a system be in an unsatifactory state, 
the interested parties know whom they need to contact.

To install the application, simply clone the repository and run:
`npm install`

To run the application, run:
`npm start`
